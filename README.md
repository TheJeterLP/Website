# NodeJS-Website


NPM, NodeJS and PM2 need to be installed.
On First startup, run <br>
  `npm install`<br>
  `npm run css-build`<br>
to install all the neccessary dependencies.

# Development

simply run `npm run dev` to start server and it will automatically restart once you make changes.

# Production
Then to start the webserver just run the `start.sh`, to stop just run the `stop.sh`
<br>
Also you should setup an Apache2 Webserver and Proxy the NodeJS Server to that.
